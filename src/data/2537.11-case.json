					"feedback": "<div class=\"notes\"><p>Diagnostic testing revealed fibrocavitary NTM-LD—specifically, MAC-LD. After reviewing treatment guidelines, and having a discussion with Pete about risks, benefits, and possible side effects, we determined that the best initial treatment plan would be a 3-drug regimen of azithromycin, ethambutol, and rifampin, plus intravenous (IV) amikacin as adjuvant therapy for 2 to 3 months.</p><p>After 6 months on therapy, Pete's sputum cultures had failed to convert to negative. Again based on the guidelines and a discussion with Pete, we decided that the best course of action would be to add ALIS to his treatment regimen, in the hopes that Pete would achieve sputum conversion within the next 6 months.</p></div><h1>Guideline-based treatment recommendations</h1><p>Initial treatment recommendations for NTM-LD vary and are based on myriad factors, including severity of disease, whether the disease is cavitary or bronchiectatic, mycobacterium species, and whether the disease is susceptible to certain antibiotics—in particular, macrolides and amikacin. In this case, the diagnosis was non–macrolide-susceptible cavitary MAC-LD. <a href=\"https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-ntm-diseases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Treatment guidelines in patients</a> with this diagnosis recommend a 3-drug regimen, including daily azithromycin, ethambutol, and rifamycin, with the addition of parenteral amikacin for the first 2 to 3 months. If sputum culture conversion does not occur after the first 6 months of therapy, the addition of ALIS is advised. Treatment should be continued for ≥12 months following culture conversion.<sup>2</sup></p><h3>2-drug vs 3-drug regimen and inclusion of a macrolide</h3><p>Macrolide susceptibility is a significant concern in patients with MAC-LD. Macrolide monotherapy has been shown to increase the risk for acquired macrolide resistance—a risk that is mitigated by the addition of ethambutol and/or rifamycin.<sup>2,7</sup> The panel that developed the NTM-LD guidelines preferred azithromycin over clarithromycin \"because of better tolerance, less drug-interactions, lower pill burden, single daily dosing, and equal efficacy,\"<sup>2</sup> but allows that clarithromycin is an acceptable alternative if azithromycin is not available or is not tolerated. For the treatment of cavitary MAC-LD, a daily macrolide-based regimen therapy is recommended.<sup>2</sup></p><p>In addition to a macrolide, treatment may include either ethambutol or ethambutol and a rifamycin. A clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03672630) sponsored by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute is currently under way to compare 2-antibiotic vs 3-antibiotic regimens for the treatment of MAC-LD.<sup>8</sup> Little prior research has been conducted on the subject, and until more information becomes available, the guidelines recommend treating MAC-LD with a 3-drug regimen, including a macrolide, ethambutol, and a rifamycin (preferably rifampicin).<sup>2</sup></p><h3>Addition of parenteral amikacin to initial treatment</h3><p>Amikacin has been shown to be effective in treating MAC-LD, but is also associated with renal and auditory toxicity. Based on the results of a study published in 2007<sup>9</sup> and their own experiences, the panel that drafted the NTM-LD guidelines believed that the benefits outweighed the risks regarding the administration of an aminoglycoside for ≥2 to 3 months to supplement the treatment of cavitary, advanced/severe bronchiectatic, or macrolide-resistant MAC-LD.<sup>2</sup> The 2007 ATS/IDSA guidelines on NTM diseases note that amikacin is preferred by some physicians because its vestibular toxicity is less severe than that of streptomycin.<sup>10</sup> To date, no studies have evaluated the relative efficacy of parenteral amikacin vs streptomycin in patients with MAC-LD.</p><h3>Addition of ALIS following initial treatment failure</h3><p>ALIS limits the systemic toxicity associated with parenteral amikacin. Treatment recommendations regarding the use of ALIS as add-on therapy in patients with refractory MAC-LD (ie, those whose sputum cultures are still positive after 6 months of GBT) were derived from the results of 2 major studies.<sup>2,11,12</sup></p><p>The first study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01315236) was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (followed by an open-label extension study) that investigated the efficacy and safety of ALIS in patients with treatment-refractory MAC or M abscessus lung disease.<sup>11</sup> Patients received GBT and either ALIS or placebo. The primary endpoint—that is, a reduction in semiquantitative mycobacterial growth—was not reached. Significantly more patients in the GBT-plus-ALIS cohort than in the placebo group, however, achieved sputum conversion after 84 days and showed improvement in 6-minute walk distance. Most patients (approximately 90%) in both groups experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent AE (TEAE). A larger percentage of patients in the treatment group than in the placebo group experienced the following TEAEs<sup>11</sup>:</p><ul class=\"custom-list\"><li>Dysphonia (43.2% vs 8.9%, respectively)</li><li>Cough (31.8% vs 13.3%, respectively)</li><li>Fatigue (15.9% vs 8.9%, respectively)</li><li>Chest discomfort (11.4% vs 0%, respectively)</li><li>Wheezing (9.1% vs 2.2%, respectively)</li>2%, respectively)</li></ul><p>The most common serious AEs were bronchiectasis exacerbation and pneumonia.<sup>11</sup></p><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30216086/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">CONVERT</a> (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02344004) was a phase 3, randomized, prospective, open-label, non–placebo-controlled trial that compared the efficacy and safety of GBT plus ALIS with GBT alone in 336 adults with treatment-refractory MAC-LD.<sup>12</sup> Results of CONVERT showed that the proportion of patients who achieved culture conversion at 6 months (the primary endpoint of the study) was higher in individuals who received ALIS than in those who did not (29.0% vs 8.9%, respectively; OR, 4.22; 95% CI, 2.08 to 8.57; P <.001).<sup>12</sup> The most common TEAEs in the GBT-plus-ALIS group were the following<sup>12</sup>:</p><ul class=\"custom-list\"><li>Dysphonia (45.7%)</li><li>Cough (37.2%)</li><li>Dyspnea (21.5%)</li><li>Hemoptysis (17.5%)</li><li>Fatigue (16.1%)</li><li>Diarrhea (12.6%)</li><li>Nausea (11.2%)</li><li>Oropharyngeal pain (10.8%)</li></ul><p>In 2018, the FDA approved ALIS for the treatment of refractory MAC-LD.<sup>13</sup> The NTM-LD guidelines recommend the addition of ALIS to GBT for those patients with MAC-LD whose sputum cultures have not converted after 6 months on GBT.<sup>2</sup></p>"

The dysphonia was managed symptomatically with a combination of rinsing his mouth after using the nebulizer, gargling with warm water, and using lozenges. He also began bronchodilator pretreatment, which significantly improved his dyspnea.</p></div><h1>Adverse events associated with MAC-LD treatment</h1><p>The antimicrobials used for the treatment of MAC-LD, particularly for severe disease, are associated with multiple AEs. This can lead to patient nonadherence or the need to discontinue at least 1 medication—both of which can result in macrolide resistance or poor treatment response.<sup>14</sup> It is important to make patients aware of the possible negative side effects associated with their MAC-LD treatment, so that you can monitor and manage any toxicities that may arise. This, in turn, will help ensure patients' adherence to and tolerability of their treatment regimen. The guidelines note that, to date, no studies have identified the best approach for monitoring treatment-related AEs, suggesting that individualized monitoring plans be developed for each patient based on \"age, comorbidities, concurrent drugs, overlapping drug toxicities, and resources.\"<sup>2</sup> Table 1 presents common AEs associated with the agents mentioned in this course, as well as guideline-recommended monitoring strategies.<sup>2</sup></p><h3>Macrolides</h3><p>Macrolides are most commonly known to cause gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea and diarrhea), as well as auditory toxicities (ie, tinnitus and hearing loss, particularly with azithromycin); hepatotoxicity (particularly with clarithromycin); and cardiotoxicity (QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes [TdP]).<sup>15-17</sup></p><p>Gastrointestinal symptoms, auditory toxicity, and hepatotoxicity can often be managed by lowering the macrolide dose,<sup>14,15</sup> but this must be weighed against the potential of a suboptimal treatment response. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also be improved by switching macrolides, taking the medication at night, and providing supportive therapy (such as antiemetics).<sup>14,15</sup> Be aware that the concomitant use of loperamide with azithromycin or clarithromycin increases the risk for QT/QTc prolongation and TdP, so additional monitoring is necessary.<sup>18</sup> Cardiac toxicities resolve on discontinuation of the macrolide,<sup>16</sup> but again, the risks and benefits of this decision must be weighed seriously.</p><h3>Ethambutol</h3><p>Ethambutol has been shown to cause ocular toxicity<sup>19</sup> and, in rare cases, peripheral neuropathy.<sup>20-23</sup> Ocular toxicity affects the optic nerve, most commonly causing a decrease in visual acuity and the loss of green and red color discrimination.<sup>19</sup> Discontinuation of ethambutol usually resolves the visual disturbances, although occasionally an individual's vision continues to decline for a time following drug cessation before resolution and, in rare cases, the abnormalities are permanent.<sup>19</sup> However, discontinuation of ethambutol should be weighed against the risk of developing macrolide resistance<sup>2,7</sup>; a switch to a different class of antibiotics should be considered.<sup>14</sup></p><h3>Rifampicin</h3><p>Hepatotoxicity and hypersensitivity are the main AEs associated with rifampicin.<sup>24-26</sup> Rifampicin hepatotoxicity usually manifests as cholestasis or elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In a recent survey of 21 NTM-LD experts, discontinuation (with possible reintroduction) of rifampicin was suggested only in cases of severe hepatotoxicity.<sup>14</sup> Hypersensitivity manifestations can be minor (ie, gastrointestinal symptoms, cutaneous reactions, and flulike syndrome) or major (ie, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, shock, pulmonary insufficiency, and acute renal insufficiency).<sup>24</sup></p><p>Uveitis is a possible AE associated specifically with rifabutin use and should be monitored.<sup>2</sup> It is also important to bear in mind that many drug-drug interactions are possible with rifampicin.<sup>27</sup></p><h3>Aminoglycosides</h3><p>Aminoglycosides are well known for their ototoxicity. Of the 2 aminoglycosides generally used for the treatment of MAC-LD, streptomycin tends to cause more vestibular toxicity, whereas amikacin is likely to be more cochleotoxic.<sup>28,29</sup> Lowering the frequency of administration may be preferable to lowering the dosage since the antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides is dose-dependent,<sup>14</sup> although neither strategy has been shown definitively to predict ototoxicity.<sup>30,31</sup> Because hearing loss may or may not be reversible, the development of ototoxicity is often a reason for aminoglycoside discontinuation.<sup>32,33</sup></p><p>Although it is unclear whether decreasing the dose or dosing frequency reduces aminoglycoside ototoxicity, both strategies may have a mitigating impact on nephrotoxicity<sup>31,32</sup>—the other significant toxicity associated with aminoglycosides. In fact, aminoglycosides are among the most nephrotoxic therapeutic agents in common use.<sup>34</sup> (Some evidence shows that [parenteral] amikacin carries a lower risk for nephrotoxicity than do the other aminoglycosides.<sup>35</sup>) Clinical patterns of aminoglycoside-induced renal insufficiency vary—that is, reversible or irreversible, mild or leading to acute renal failure<sup>30,32,34,36</sup>—and are influenced by myriad factors, including duration of treatment, prior aminoglycoside therapy, patient age, and comorbidities.<sup>36</sup> Electrolyte balance is also a consideration and should be monitored.<sup>37,38</sup></p><h3>Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension (ALIS)  </h3><p>ALIS was designed to deliver high concentrations of amikacin directly to the lungs, which limits systemic exposure and, therefore, systemic toxicity. In the phase 3 CONVERT trial, TEAEs common to systemic aminoglycosides (nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, including vestibular toxicity) were rare and were similar in frequency between the control arm (GBT alone) and the treatment arm (GBT plus ALIS),<sup>12</sup> with the only exception being tinnitus. Although tinnitus occurred more often in the treatment arm than in the control arm, only 1 such event led to treatment discontinuation.<sup>12</sup></p><p>By contrast, the rates of respiratory-related AEs (mainly dysphonia, cough, and dyspnea) were considerably higher in the treatment arm than in the control arm (87.4% vs 50.0%, respectively).<sup>12</sup> A patient survey was designed to gauge the frequency of and evaluate the clinical management strategies for respiratory AEs associated with ALIS use.<sup>39</sup> Table 2 displays these management strategies. A total of 24 patients reported respiratory AEs following initiation of ALIS therapy. Physician-directed management was needed by 79.2% (19 of 24) of these patients; all of them reported symptom improvement in ≥1 AE category.<sup>39</sup></p><h3>Table 1.
