			"description": "<p>Cindy is a 56-year-old now postmenopausal woman who was first diagnosed with right T2N1 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer at the age of 48. Germline genetic testing was negative for deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.</p><p>She underwent upfront breast conservation surgery and received adjuvant docetaxel and cyclophosphamide for 4 cycles, followed by radiation. She received adjuvant anastrozole for 5 years.</p><p>Approximately 2 years ago (6 years after diagnosis, and 1 year after discontinuation of anastrozole), Cindy developed a cough and exacerbation of her chronic lower back pain. Chest x-ray noted a suspicious lung mass. Computed tomography (CT) of her chest/abdomen/pelvis identified a 5 cm right hilar mass, several small liver lesions of concern, and multiple osseous metastases. A biopsy of the lung mass confirmed metastatic breast cancer, ER 90%, progesterone receptor (PR) 5%, HER2-negative.</p><p>At this time, she began first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer with letrozole and palbociclib. Denosumab was added to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events.</p><p>After about 10 months on treatment, scans demonstrated disease progression with larger liver lesions, although normal liver function. Her Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score is 90%.</p><p>She received fulvestrant for second-line treatment, but unfortunately after about 6 months, scans reveal additional lung and liver lesions. Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level is mildly elevated at approximately 45 U/L.</p><p>Cindy went on to receive capecitabine. After about 6 months of treatment, CT of her chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed disease progression once again, and she was bothered by grade 2 hand-foot syndrome.</p>",

Most patients will be candidates for multiple lines of systemic therapy for their advanced/metastatic breast cancer, and so all of these options may be considered at some point for a patient with HER2-low breast cancer.<sup>2</sup></p><p>T-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of an anti-HER2 antibody, a cleavable linker, and a cytotoxic \"payload\" that is a topoisomerase I inhibitor.<sup>3</sup> It was previously approved for treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who had received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen,<sup>4</sup> based on results from the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1914510?articleTools=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">DESTINY-Breast01 clinical trial</a>.<sup>3</sup> More recently, it was approved for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-negative) breast cancer who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy,<sup>4</sup> and it has a category 1 guideline recommendation for this use.<sup>2</sup></p><p>Use of T-DXd in patients with HER2-low breast cancer was investigated in the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35665782/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">DESTINY-Breast04 trial</a>.<sup>5</sup> This trial enrolled 557 patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer—defined as a score of 1+ on IHC or a score of 2+ on IHC with negative ISH—who had received one or two previous lines of chemotherapy, to be randomized to treatment with T-DXd or physician's choice of chemotherapy. In the trial, 88.7% of patients had HR-positive disease and 11.3% had HR-negative disease; approximately 70% of enrolled patients had prior exposure to a CDK4/6 inhibitor, while approximately 5% had received prior immunotherapy. The majority had visceral disease, with approximately 5% having brain metastases.<sup>5</sup></p><p>The primary trial efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the HR-positive patient cohort, which was significantly improved with T-DXd compared with chemotherapy. In these patients, median PFS was 10.1 months with T-DXd compared with 5.4 months with chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51; P <.001). Overall survival (OS) was also significantly improved with T-DXd, from 17.5 months with chemotherapy to 23.9 months with T-DXd (HR 0.64; P = .003).<sup>5</sup></p><p>These results were similar among all enrolled patients (both HR-positive and HR-negative): median PFS was 9.9 months with T-DXd compared with 5.1 months with chemotherapy (HR 0.50; P <.001), and median OS was 23.4 months compared with 16.8 months, respectively (HR 0.64; P = .001).<sup>5</sup></p><p>The chemotherapy options listed in this question all received a category 2A guideline recommendation—they are all appropriate regimens to consider, but appear to have lower efficacy than T-DXd in this setting.<sup>2,5</sup> Administration of single-agent chemotherapy sequentially decreases the likelihood that dose reductions will be needed for the management of side effects, and there is currently no compelling evidence that combination regimens are superior to single-agent regimens. Therefore, sequential monotherapy is preferred for most patients with recurrent metastatic disease.<sup>2</sup> Following progression on T-DXd, all of these options would be appropriate to consider for the next line of therapy for the patient in this case.</p>"
