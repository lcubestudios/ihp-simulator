A mammogram and an ultrasound were ordered, and the mammogram revealed a large mass measuring close to 6 cm with associated suspicious calcifications. Ultrasound revealed at least 3 suspicious axillary lymph nodes. The tumor mass was measured to be 6.2 cm x 3.5 cm. Biopsy confirmed an invasive ductal carcinoma grade 3. In addition, there was evidence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), 80% estrogen receptor (ER) positive, 50% progesterone receptor (PR) positive, and HER2- (0 by IHC) and Ki-67 score 30%. Fine needle aspiration of her lymph nodes was positive for malignancy.</p><p>Paula's genetic evaluation was negative for pathogenic germline mutations. She was not interested in fertility preservation. At the time of presentation, she underwent an extensive review of systems and stated that she had low back pain, which was evaluated with computed tomography (CT) and bone scans; there was no evidence of metastatic disease.</p><p>Paula received neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel for 12 cycles and dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for 4 cycles. She experienced typical mild toxicities but did not experience any serious side effects. There was mild reduction in the size of her tumor during chemotherapy, but no change in the size or shape of the lymph nodes. She then underwent a right mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Pathology demonstrated mild treatment effect, and the pathology report indicated a residual tumor measuring 5.5 cm x 3.0 cm with 40% cellularity. Axillary lymph node dissection found 2 of 12 positive axillary nodes, with the largest metastases measuring 1.5 cm.</p><p>She recovered well from surgery and has started her postmastectomy radiation therapy but wants to discuss additional steps in her treatment to reduce risk of recurrence.</p>",

However, all patients are at risk for recurrence over time, with evidence showing a persistent risk of recurrence and death due to breast cancer for up to 20 years or more following the original diagnosis, based on a meta-analysis of 88 trials of 62,923 women with HR+ breast cancer who were disease-free after treatment with ET for 5 years.<sup>1,2</sup> Notably, there are patients who are at a higher risk of recurrence, such as those with ≥4 positive axillary lymph nodes and a Ki-67 score ≥20% or those with 1 to 3 positive axillary lymph nodes and at least one of the following: tumor size ≥5 cm, tumor size ≥5 cm among patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy, histological grade 3, Ki-67 score ≥20%, Ki-67 score ≥20% only, or Ki-67 score ≥20% and tumor size ≥5 cm and/or histological grade 3.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Ki-67 IHC is a widely used biomarker to evaluate tumor proliferation based on its expression in proliferative cell cycle phases (G1, G2, and M).<sup>4,5</sup> A Ki-67 score is defined as the total number of staining and nonstaining viable tumor cells in the invasive cancer component x 100.<sup>4</sup>  The International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group notes that Ki-67 is clinically valid for determining prognosis for a patient with early-stage breast cancer, but with specific clinical utility.<sup>5</sup> The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) does not currently recommend assessment of Ki-67, unless the patient is HR+, HER2-, and adjuvant abemaciclib is being considered.<sup>6</sup></p><p>In this case, the patient's Ki-67 score is 30%, based on pathology reports from the initial biopsy and surgical specimen. Furthermore, the patient's risk of recurrence at 5 years is approximately 30% to 35%. This is based on clinicopathological features like grade 3 breast cancer, LVI, and high Ki-67 (>30%).</p><p>There are various methods available to estimate a patient's risk of recurrence. For example, the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition incorporates anatomic factors, tumor grade, receptor status, and tumor multigene panel testing for prognostic staging of patients who have received adjuvant therapy.<sup>7</sup></p><p>Risk of recurrence can also be calculated in patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy, despite limited use of neoadjuvant therapy in clinical practice.<sup>8</sup> The residual cancer burden (RCB) method provides standardized methods to evaluate and quantify the extent of residual disease in a patient's lymph nodes (breast and axillary) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The result is a continuous score with cut points defining four RCB classes that represent increasing residual disease burden from RCB-0 to RCB-3.<sup>9</sup> In this case, the patient has an RCB-3 score corresponding to a 5-year disease free survival of 70%. Another method utilizes the CPS + EG staging system, which combines the presenting clinical stage and post-treatment pathological stage, along with ER status and nuclear grade.<sup>10</sup> In this patient's case, her CPS + EG score is 3, corresponding to a 5-year distant metastases-free survival of 79%.</p><p>In addition, at the time of this patient's presentation, she had stated that she had low back pain. CT and bone scans may be useful for evaluating potential spread of disease.<sup>11</sup> An echocardiogram may be required before starting treatment with chemotherapy, for example, or to assess the patient for treatment-related cardiotoxicity.<sup>12</sup></p>"

Given Paula's high risk of recurrence, every possible effort should be made to optimize her adjuvant therapy. In this case, the recommendation is to add abemaciclib for 2 years to her ET, considering the patient's values and preferences.</p><p>According to the most recent version of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Breast Cancer, 2 years of adjuvant abemaciclib can be considered in combination with ET if patients have HR+, HER2-, high-risk breast cancer. High-risk breast cancer is defined as those with ≥4 positive lymph nodes, or 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes with ≥1 of the following: Grade 3 disease, tumor size ≥5 cm, or a Ki-67 score  ≥20%.<sup>6</sup> The American Society of Clinical Oncology also recommends 2 years of adjuvant abemaciclib plus ET in patients with HR+, HER2-, node-positive, early breast cancer with a high risk of recurrence and a Ki-67 score ≥20%; 2 years of abemaciclib plus ET for ≥5 years may be offered to patients with resected, HR+, HER2-, node-positive, early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence, as defined by the NCCN guidelines above.<sup>13</sup></p><p>These recommendations are based on evidence from the open-label, global, randomized, phase 3, monarchE study of abemaciclib added to standard adjuvant ET vs ET alone in patients with HR+/HER2-, node-positive, high-risk (as defined above), early breast cancer. Patients (N=5637) were allowed to be treated with up to 12 weeks of ET after the last non-ET treatment prior to being randomized and were randomly assigned within 16 months of definitive breast cancer surgery. The primary endpoint was IDFS and the secondary endpoint was DRFS (defined as time from randomization to distant recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurred first).<sup>14</sup></p><p>At the time of the March 16, 2020 data cutoff, the median follow-up time was approximately 15.5 months in both treatment arms. Patients randomized to abemaciclib plus ET had a lower risk of IDFS (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.93) and the 2-year rate was 92.2% compared with 88.7% among patients in the control arm. An improvement in DRFS was also observed with abemaciclib plus ET compared with ET alone, and the 2-year rate was 93.6% and 90.3%, respectively.<sup>14</sup></p><p>Results from a prespecified primary outcome analysis (data cutoff of July 8, 2020), a regulatory request for additional follow-up analysis (data cutoff of April 1, 2021), and Ki-67 levels are also available and based on a median follow-up of 19 to 27 months. The abemaciclib plus ET arm continued to demonstrate clinically meaningful benefit in the primary outcome analysis, and the IDFS effect size was even greater (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.87; P<0.001). Similarly, clinically meaningful benefit was observed for DRFS in the abemaciclib plus ET arm (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.83; P<0.001). In the additional follow-up, the benefit was maintained for both IDFS and DRFS. In addition, in the Ki-67-high population (Ki-67 ≥20%), abemaciclib plus ET significantly reduced the risk developing both IDFS and DRFS events.<sup>15</sup></p><p>Efficacy and safety data are also available from the primary outcome analysis (data cutoff of July 8, 2020) for patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which was 36.5% of the monarchE population. Consistent with the primary results, patients randomized to abemaciclib plus ET had a lower risk of developing an IDFS event compared with ET alone (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80; P<0.001) and of developing a DRFS event.<sup>16</sup></p><p>Paula is not a candidate to receive olaparib because she has no pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 mutations.<sup>17</sup> Capecitabine is not a viable option because the benefit of capecitabine was mostly seen among patients with triple-negative breast cancer in the CREATE-X trial.<sup>18</sup> Palbociclib is not an option because adjuvant palbociclib plus ET did not improve outcomes in the HR+ patient population.<sup>19</sup> Abemaciclib is therefore the only FDA-approved cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor to be used in the adjuvant setting. Immunotherapy has no role in this patient.</p><p>In addition to the efficacy and safety data, it is critical to involve the patient in shared decision-making, based on research showing its favorable impact on health outcomes, along with increased confidence about choices, increased satisfaction with treatment, and increased patient trust in their providers.<sup>20,21</sup> Shared decision-making is a process that involves patients, their caregiver(s), and providers, all of whom work together to make fully informed treatment decisions based on the best available evidence and taking into consideration the patient's values and preferences.<sup>20</sup> And it is especially appropriate in scenarios where various treatment options are available and when the patient's values and preferences drive the decision-making process.<sup>20</sup> Ensuring the patient is fully informed is a key step, especially given the complexity of cancer care and patient experience of feeling overwhelmed or underinformed during the consultation with their physician.<sup>21,22</sup> A number of strategies can be utilized to engage patients in this process, such as providing a reliable way for patients to get answers to their questions, assessing barriers to care, using the teach-back method to evaluate and increase patient understanding of information, provision of high-quality and consistent patient education information, etc.<sup>20</sup></p>"

As such, abemaciclib was suspended until her diarrhea resolved, and she was restarted on the same dose of abemaciclib, without recurrence.</p><p>Safety findings from the phase 3 monarchE study of abemaciclib plus ET compared to ET alone included 5591 patients, of which 5141 experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent AE (97.9% of patients in the abemaciclib plus ET group compared with 86.1% in the ET group).<sup>14</sup> Table 1 shows adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of patients and with a difference between arms of ≥2% in monarchE.<sup>23</sup></p><h3>Table 1.

As such, when it comes to patient safety, this could entail eliciting the patient's perspective on the risks and benefits of treatment and addressing their concerns, communicating the importance of medication adherence, preparing the patient to recognize AEs as they occur and instructing them on appropriate action, acknowledging and validating patient-reported symptoms, and offering solutions to help minimize side effects.<sup>25</sup></p><p>Since Paula wants to minimize her risk of breast cancer recurrence, she understands the rationale for the treatment recommendation, but needs additional information and education on how to manage potential side effects. Many clinicians like to provide patients with written information describing these side effects, and this is usually very helpful. It is important to provide the patient with close follow-up to monitor tolerance.</p><p>According to the prescribing information for abemaciclib, monitoring complete blood counts for signs of neutropenia should start before treatment, continue every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated.<sup>23</sup> Patients should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of thrombosis (ie, venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism).<sup>23</sup></p><p>Information on management of diarrhea is essential and highlighted in Table 2, and dose reductions, if needed, are appropriate.<sup>23</sup></p><h3>Table 2.</h3><div><img src=\"https://cdn.atpoc.com/cdn/ihp/2539.11/assets/2539.11_3_1-2_feedback.png\" /></div><p>Abbreviation: CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.</p><p>Due to the safety and monitoring considerations of her treatment, communication and coordination are critical within the multidisciplinary care team and with the patient. The patient must have contact information to connect with the medical team if issues present and patients should be educated on the identification of emergencies. Here, it should be emphasized that members of the multidisciplinary care team can support patient-centered care by assisting with patient education, monitoring, and timely follow-up to address issues related to side effects.<sup>26</sup></p><p>Given the potential impact of side effects on adherence to treatment and subsequent detrimental impact on outcomes, persistence and adherence to therapy are also important to address. This is especially pertinent with oral anticancer medications that may be administered at home.<sup>27</sup> While the evidence base supporting the use of specific tools and strategies to address medication adherence is varied, the literature suggests that multidimensional interventions focusing on collective strategies (eg, education, reminder, cognitive, behavioral, and affective) to promote adherence are potentially more effective than single strategies like education, reminders, or monitoring, for example.<sup>27</sup> In addition, interventions encouraging bidirectional communication promote greater adherence, and may include eliciting information from, and providing information to, patients.<sup>28</sup> Some specific strategies and tools for use might be<sup>29</sup>:</p><ul class=\"custom-list\"><li>Addressing patient misconceptions about the specified treatment</li><li>Encouraging and facilitating communication among the care team, patients, and family</li><li>Emphasizing the benefits of persistence and adherence to treatment</li><li>Educating patients on other consequences of poor adherence, such as unnecessary changes to treatment</li><li>Promoting routine monitoring and not missing appointments</li><li>Scheduling frequent follow-ups to discuss challenges with treatment</li><li>Educating patients to be proactive about managing side effects of their treatment</li><li>Instructing patients to contact their care team when and if severe side effects occur</li><li>Engaging patients and family members in understanding the disease, treatment risks and benefits, and potential interactions with food or other medicines</li><li>Providing patient tools to support dose management and monitoring at home (eg, pillboxes, calendar, electronic reminders, support groups)</li><li>Supporting patient access to treatment, such as through short-term prescriptions or money-saving refill options</li></ul><p>Notably, nurses and pharmacists are well positioned to play a key role in promoting adherence. For example, nurse provision of clinical support (eg, individualizing patient education according to their needs) and symptom assessment and management can empower a patient's ability to adhere to their treatment regimen.<sup>27</sup></p>"
