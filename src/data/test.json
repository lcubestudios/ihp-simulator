					"feedback": "<h1>Diagnostic criteria for NTM-LD</h1><p>The patient presented with relatively non-specific pulmonary and systemic symptoms consistent with chronic pulmonary infection. Epidemiology related to NTM in patients with COPD is limited, but one study <strong>(Andr√©jak et al 2013; p. 1 Results; p.3 para 2, para 4)</strong> indicates that the odds ratio (OR) for NTM for patients for COPD is 15.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.4 to 21.5); that number increases to 29.1% (95% CI 13.3 to 63.8) for COPD patients currently using inhaled corticosteroids. These factors considered, NTM-LD should be included in the differential diagnosis.</p><p>According to the ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA clinical guidelines, there are clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic criteria for diagnosing NTM-LD (Daley et al 2020; p. 2 Table 2).</p><h3>Clinical</h3><p>Clinical symptoms of NTM-LD are nearly indistinguishable from those of TB <strong>(Koh et al 2006; p. 1003, para 3)(Kim et al 2014; p. 727 para 2)</strong>. These symptoms include cough, sputum, hemoptysis, dyspnea, weight loss, asthenia, fever, and night sweats. </p><h3>Radiologic</h3><p>NTM-LD typically falls into one of two categories <strong>(Ellis et al 2002; p. 663 para 2)(Cowman et al 2019; p. 10 para 2)</strong>: nodular bronchiectatic disease and fibrocavitary disease. Diagnostic criteria for NTM-LD includes a chest radiograph or high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan that shows either bronchiectasis with multiple nodules, or nodular or cavitary opacities (similar to those seen with TB).</p><h3>Microbiologic</h3><p>Because the clinical and radiologic characteristics of TB and NTM-LD (especially the cavitary form) overlap, microbiologic testing is vital to identify the etiologic agent. Microbiologic criteria for the diagnosis of NTM-LD requires at least one of the following:</p><ul><li>Expectorated sputum samples &ndash; positive AFB smear, and positive cultures from at least two different sputum samples (note: repeat cultures may be necessary)</li><li>Bronchial wash or lavage &ndash; at least one positive culture</li><li>Transbronchial or other lung biopsy &ndash; mycobacterial histologic features and positive culture (note: the positive culture can be also be derived from a sputum sample or bronchial wash)</li></ul><p>It should be noted that some NTM strains are susceptible to certain antibiotics, especially macrolides and amikacin. Further, treatment recommendations vary based on species (and often subspecies). It is therefore important to request that the testing lab identify the species (and subspecies) and provide a susceptibility panel.</p>"

					"feedback": "<div class=\"notes\"><p><i>Diagnostic testing showed fibrocavitary NTM-LD, specifically MAC-LD. After reviewing treatment guidelines and a discussion with Pete about risks, benefits, and possible side effects, we determined that the best initial treatment plan would be a 3-drug regimen of azithromycin, ethambutol, and rifampin, plus IV amikacin as adjunct therapy for 2 - 3 months.</i></p><p><i>After 6 months on therapy, Pete's sputum cultures had failed to convert to negative. Again based on the guidelines and discussion with Pete, we decided that the best course of action would be to add ALIS to his treatment regimen, and hoped that Pete would achieve sputum conversion within the next 6 months.</i></p></div><h1>Guideline-based treatment recommendations</h1><p>Initial treatment recommendations for NTM-LD vary and are based on myriad factors, including: severity of disease, whether the disease is cavitary or bronchiectatic, mycobacterium species, and whether or not the disease is susceptible to certain antibiotics (especially macrolides and amikacin). In this case, the diagnosis was non&ndash;macrolide-susceptible cavitary MAC-LD. Treatment guidelines recommend a 3-drug regimen including (daily) azithromycin, ethambutol, and rifamycin, with the addition of parenteral (IV) amikacin for the first 2 &ndash; 3 months. Should sputum culture conversion not occur after the first 6 months of therapy, addition of amikacin liposomal inhalation suspension (ALIS) is advised. Treatment should be continued for at least 12 months after culture conversion <strong>(Daley et al 2020; p. 19 para 2)</strong>.</p><h3>2-drug vs 3-drug regimen and inclusion of a macrolide</h3><p>Macrolide susceptibility is of significant concern with MAC-LD. Macrolide monotherapy has been shown to increase the risk of acquired macrolide resistance, a risk that is mitigated by the addition of ethambutol and/or rifamycin <strong>(Nash 2001; p. 1607 Abstract)(Daley et al 2020; p. 4 para 11, p. 13 para 8)</strong>. The panel that produced the NTM-LD guidelines preferred azithromycin over clarithromycin ‚Äúbecause of better tolerance, less drug interactions, lower pill burden, single daily dosing, and equal efficacy <strong>(Daley et al 2020; p. 4 para 2)</strong>,‚Äù but allows that clarithromycin in an acceptable alternative in the case that azithromycin is not available or tolerated. For cavitary MAC-LD, daily macrolide therapy is recommended <strong>(Daley et al 2018; p. 19 para 2)</strong>.</p><p>In addition to a macrolide, treatment may include either ethambutol or ethambutol and a rifamycin. There is currently a clinical trial (NCT03672630) comparing 2-drug and 3-drug regimens in treating MAC-LD, sponsored by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) <strong>(PCORI updated 2022; para 4)</strong>. There has been little prior research on the subject, and until more information is available the guidelines recommend treating MAC-LD with a 3-drug regimen including a macrolide, ethambutol, and a rifamycin (preferably rifampicin) <strong>(Daley et al 2020; p. 17 para 2)</strong>.</p><h3>Addition of parenteral amikacin to initial treatment</h3><p>Amikacin has been shown to be effective in treating MAC-LD, but is also associated with renal and auditory toxicity. Based on the results of a 2007 study <strong>(Kobashi et al; p. 130 Summary; p. 137 para 3)</strong> and their own experiences, the panel that drafted the NTM-LD guidelines felt that the benefits outweighed the risks in the administration of an aminoglycoside for at least 2 &ndash; 3 months to supplement treatment of cavitary, severe bronchiectatic, or macrolide resistant MAC-LD <strong>(Daley et al 2020; p. 4 para 4; p. 15 para 2, para 4)</strong>. The 2007 ATS/IDSA guidelines regarding NTM diseases note that amikacin is preferred by some physicians because its vestibular toxicity is less severe than that of streptomycin <strong>(Griffith et al 2007; p. 389 para 7)</strong>. To date, there have been no studies looking at the relative efficacy of parenteral amikacin versus streptomycin in MAC-LD.</p><h3>Addition of ALIS following initial treatment failure</h3><p>ALIS limits the systemic toxicity associated with parenteral amikacin. Treatment recommendations regarding the use of ALIS as add on therapy for patients with refractory MAC-LD (those whose sputum cultures are still positive after 6 months of guideline-based treatment) were drawn from two major studies <strong>(Daley et al 2020; p. 16 para 1, para 2)</strong>.</p><p>The first (NCT01315236) was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (followed by an open-label extension study) investigating the efficacy and safety of ALIS in treatment-refractory MAC and M. abscessus lung disease. Patients received guideline-based therapy (GBT) and either ALIS or placebo. The primary endpoint, a reduction in semiquantitative mycobacterial growth, was not reached. However, significantly more patients in the GBT+ALIS cohort achieved sputum conversion after 84 days and showed improved 6-minute walk distance. Most patients (about 90%) in both groups experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event (AE). A larger percentage of patients in the treatment group than the placebo group experienced: </p><ul><li>dysphonia (43.2% vs 8.9%)</li><li>bronchiectasis exacerbation (38.6% vs 20.0%)</li><li>cough (31.8% vs 13.3%)</li><li>oropharyngeal pain (20.5% vs 2.2%)</li><li>fatigue (15.9% vs 8.9%) </li><li>chest discomfort (11.4% vs 0%)</li><li>wheezing (9.1% vs 2.2%)</li><li>infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (9.1% vs 2.2%)</li></ul><p>The most common serious treatment-related AEs were bronchiectasis exacerbation and pneumonia <strong>(Olivier et al 2016; p. 814 Abstract Conclusions; p. 820 para 4 &ndash; p. 821 para 1)</strong>.</p><p>CONVERT (NCT02344004) was a phase III, randomized, open label, non-placebo controlled trial, also comparing the efficacy and safety of GBT+ALIS to GBT alone in patients with treatment-refractory MAC-LD. Results showed that the proportion of patients achieving culture conversion at 6 months (the primary endpoint of the study) was higher in the patients who received ALIS than in those who did not (29.0% vs. 8.9%; odds ratio, 4.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.08&ndash;8.57; P<0.001) <strong>(Griffith et al 2018; p. 1560 Commentary para 2)</strong>. The most common treatment-related AEs in the GBT+ALIS group were <strong>(Griffith et al 2018; p. 1565 Table 3)</strong>:</p><ul><li>dysphonia (45.7%)</li><li>cough (37.2%)</li><li>dyspnea (21.5%) </li><li>hemoptysis (17.5%)</li><li>fatigue (16.1%)</li><li>diarrhea (12.6%)</li><li>nausea (11.2%)</li><li>oropharyngeal pain (10.8%)</li></ul><p>In 2018, the FDA approved ALIS for the treatment of refractory MAC-LD <strong>(FDA 2018; p.1 para 1)</strong>. The NTM guidelines recommend the addition of ALIS to GBT for those patients with MAC-LD whose sputum cultures have not converted after 6 months on GBT <strong>(Daley et al 2020; p. 15 para 7)</strong>.</p>"

					"feedback": "<div class=\"notes\"><p><i>Pete generally tolerated initial treatment well with few side effects. He complained of gastrointestinal discomfort, which improved when he began taking the azithromycin in the evenings instead of in the morning. He also experienced mild tinnitus, but this resolved when he stopped receiving IV amikacin.</i></p><p><i>One month after the addition of ALIS to his treatment plan, Pete complained of moderate dysphonia and mildly increased dyspnea. The dysphonia was managed symptomatically with a combination of rinsing his mouth after using the nebulizer, gargling with warm water, and use of lozenges. He also began bronchodilator pretreatment, which significantly improved the dyspnea.</i></p></div><h1>Adverse events associated with MAC-LD treatment</h1><p>The antimicrobials used to treat MAC-LD, especially more severe disease, are associated with multiple AEs. This can lead to patient non-adherence or the need to discontinue at least one medication, both of which can result in macrolide resistance or poor treatment response <strong>(van Ingen et al 2021; p. 256 para 1, para 2)</strong>. It is important to make patients aware of the possible negative side effects of their MAC-LD treatment, so that you can monitor and manage any toxicities that may arise. This in turn will help ensure patients' adherence to and tolerability of their treatment regimen. The guidelines note that there have not been any studies identifying the best approach for monitoring treatment-related AEs, suggesting that individualized monitoring plans be developed for each patient based on ‚Äúage, comorbidities, concurrent drugs, overlapping drug toxicities, and resources <strong>(Daley et al 2020; p. 30 para 3 to p. 31 para 1)</strong>.‚Äù Table 1 presents common adverse events related to the drugs mentioned in this course, as well as guideline-recommended monitoring strategies <strong>(Daley et al 2020; p. 30 Table 6)</strong>.</p><h3>Macrolides</h3><p>Macrolides are most commonly known to cause gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea and diarrhea), as well as auditory toxicities (tinnitus and hearing loss), hepatotoxicity (especially clarithromycin), and cardiotoxicity (QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes [TdP]) <strong>(Brown et al 1997; p. 963 para 2)(Guo et al 2010; p. 1 Abstract)(Periti et al 1993; p. 347 para 2)</strong>.</p><p>Gastrointestinal symptoms, auditory toxicity, and hepatotoxicity can often be managed by lowering the macrolide dose <strong>(Brown et al 1997; p. 963 para 3)(van Ingen et al 2021; p. 258 para 2)</strong>, but this must be weighed against the potential of a suboptimal treatment response. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also be improved by switching macrolides, taking the medication at night, and providing supportive therapy (such as anti-emetics) <strong>(Brown et al 1997; p. 959 para 3)(van Ingen et al 2021; p. 258 para 2)</strong>. Be aware that concomitant use of loperamide with azithromycin or clarithromycin increases the risk of QT/QTc prolongation and TdP, so that additional monitoring is necessary (<strong>PDR &ndash; loperamide; p. 6 Azithromycin, p. 7 Clarithromycin)</strong>. Cardiac toxicities resolve on discontinuation of the macrolide <strong>(Guo et al 2010; p. 638 para 1, para 4)</strong>, but again, the risks and benefits of this decision must be seriously weighed.</p><h3>Ethambutol</h3><p>Ethambutol has been shown to cause ocular toxicity <strong>(Griffith et al 2005; p. 1 Abstract, para 2)</strong> and, in rare cases, peripheral neuropathy <strong>(Arshad et al 2016; p.1 Introduction)(Geyer et al 2014; p. 257 Abstract)(Nair et al 1980; p. 98 Abstract)(Tugwell et al 1972; p. 667 Summary)</strong>. Ocular toxicity affects the optic nerve and most commonly causes a decrease in visual acuity and loss of green and red color discrimination <strong>(Griffith et al 2005; p. 1 para 2)</strong>. Discontinuation of ethambutol usually resolves the visual disturbances, though occasionally vision continues to decline for a time after drug cessation before resolving, and in rare cases the abnormalities are permanent <strong>(Griffith et al 2005; p. 1 para 2)</strong>. However, discontinuation of ethambutol should be weighed against the risk of creating macrolide resistance <strong>(Nash 2001; p. 1 Abstract)(Daley et al 2020; p. 13 para 8)</strong>; a switch to a different class of antibiotics should be considered <strong>(van Ingen 2021; p. 257 para 2; p. 258 para 1)</strong>.</p><h3>Rifampicin</h3><p>Hepatotoxicity and hypersensitivity are the main AEs associated with rifampicin <strong>(Grosset et al 1983; p. S440 Abstract)(Kamii et al 2018; p. 1506 para 7)(Martinez et al 1999; p. 361 Introduction)</strong>. Rifampicin hepatotoxicity usually manifests as cholestasis or elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT); in a recent survey of 21 NTM-LD experts, discontinuation (with possible reintroduction) of rifampicin was suggested only in cases of severe hepatotoxicity <strong>(van Ingen et al 2021; p. 256 para 5)</strong>. Hypersensitivity manifestations can be minor (gastrointestinal symptoms, cutaneous reactions, and flu-like syndrome) or major (thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, shock, pulmonary insufficiency, and acute renal insufficiency) <strong>(Grosset et al 1983; p. S442 para 2)</strong>.</p><p>Uveitis is also a possible AE and should be monitored <strong>(Daley et al 2020; p. 30 Table 6)</strong>. It's also important to keep in mind that many drug-drug interactions are possible with rifampicin <strong>(Saukkonen et al 2006; p. 940 para 5)</strong>.</p><h3>Aminoglycosides</h3><p>Aminoglycosides are well known for their ototoxicity. Of the two aminoglycosides generally used for the treatment of MAC-LD, streptomycin tends to cause more vestibular toxicity, while amikacin tends to be more cochleotoxic <strong>(Black et al 1976; p. 957 para 7, para 8)(Selimoglu 2007; p. 119 Abstract)</strong>. Lowering the frequency of administration may be preferable to lowering the dosage since the antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides is dose dependent <strong>(van Ingen et al 2021; p. e258 para 4)</strong>, though neither strategy has been definitively shown to predict ototoxicity <strong>(Peloquin et al 2004; p. 1541 para 3)(Rybak et al 1999; p. 1554 para 4)</strong>. Because hearing loss may or may not be reversible, development of ototoxicity is often a reason for aminoglycoside discontinuation <strong>(Aznar et al 2019; p. 4, para 2)(Griffith et al 2006; p. 929 para 3)</strong>.</p><p>While it is unclear whether decreasing the dose or dosing frequency reduces aminoglycoside ototoxicity, both strategies may have a mitigating impact on nephrotoxicity <strong>(Aznar et al 2019; p. 4 para 3)(Rybak et al 1999; p.1549 Abstract)</strong>, the other significant toxicity associated with aminoglycosides. In fact, aminoglycosides are among the most nephrotoxic therapeutic agents in common use <strong>(Markowitz et al 2004; p. 32 Introduction; p. 33 para 3)</strong>. (There is some evidence that [parenteral] amikacin carries a lower risk of nephrotoxicity than other aminoglycosides <strong>[Jenkins et al 2016; p.8 para 2; p. 22 Figure 1]</strong>.) Clinical patterns of aminoglycoside-induced renal insufficiency vary &ndash; reversible or irreversible, mild or leading to acute renal failure <strong>(Appel 1990; p. 18S Table 1)(Aznar et al 2019; p. 4, para 3)(Markowitz et al 2004; p. 34 para 2)(Peloquin et al 2004; p. 1542 para 3)</strong> &ndash; and are influenced by myriad factors such as duration of therapy, prior aminoglycoside therapy, patient age, and comorbidities <strong>(Appel 1990; p. 18S para 3, Table 2)</strong>. Electrolyte balance is also a consideration, and should be monitored <strong>(Alexandridis et al 2003; p. 118 Abstract, Introduction)(Melnick et al 1994; p. 118 Abstract, para 1; p. 120 para 2)</strong>.</p><h3>Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension (ALIS)</h3><p>ALIS was designed to deliver high concentrations of amikacin directly to the lungs, which limits systemic exposure and, therefore, systemic toxicity. In the phase III CONVERT trial, treatment-related AEs common to systemic aminoglycosides (nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, including vestibular toxicity) were rare, and similar in frequency between the control arm (guideline-based therapy [GBT] alone) and the treatment arm (GBT + ALIS) <strong>(Griffith et al 2018; p. 1567 para 2)</strong>. (The only exception was tinnitus, which was more common in the treatment arm but only led to treatment discontinuation in 1 event <strong>[Griffith et al 2018; p. 1566 para 2]</strong>.)</p><p>By contrast, the rates of respiratory treatment-related AEs were significantly higher in the treatment arm than the control arm (87.4% versus 50.0%, respectively) <strong>(Griffith et al 2018; p. 1559 Abstract Conclusions; p. 1567 para 6)</strong>. Most common were dysphonia, cough, and dyspnea <strong>(Griffith et al 2018; p. 1559 Abstract Conclusions)</strong>. A patient survey was designed to gauge the frequency of and evaluate clinical management strategies for respiratory AEs associated with ALIS <strong>(Swenson et al 2020; p.1 Abstract)</strong>. Table 2 reflects these management strategies. 24 patients reported respiratory AEs related to ALIS treatment. Physician-directed management was needed by 19 (79.2%) of these patients; all of them reported symptom improvement in at least 1 AE category <strong>(Swenson et al 2020; p. 2 para 3)</strong>.</p><h3>Table 1.
